      <h3>Home page: What is Slacklining</h3>
      <p>
        What is slacklining? Slacklining is balancing on a one- to two-inch-wide flat rope called tubular webbing which is fixed to normally two points (for example: trees). Slacklining is a great sport for those wanting to find an independent sport, that helps with balance, strength, and can also be shared with others.
        Types of slacklines
        There are many different types of slacklining, including: Waterlining, Highlining, Tricklining, Yogalining, and Rodeolining. With all these different types of slacklining, they all require similar skills, gear, and knowledge. 
        Waterlining is slacklining over water which can be difficult but is safer.
        Highlining is slacklining over 10 meters in height. To highline requires a lot of safety, a rig that uses a specific system, and care. You will also need a harness to attach yourself to the line incase of a fall. After taking the care and precautions of making highlining safe, it is a very safe sport.
        Tricklining is slacklining with stretchy tubular webbing with high tensions (like a thin trampoline). Trickliners have done some amazing tricks on these things.   
        Yogalining is practicing yoga poses on a slacklining. This creates a yoga experience that is even more intense and interesting.
        Rodeoline is a slackline with loose tension, creating a more U shape than a line. This is primarily more for training and swinging the line from side to side. 
        This website is to help you get started with slacklining and see if this is the sport for you.

      <h3>How To Get Started</h3>
      <p>
        Gear First you will need to get some gear. If you are wanting to slackline less than 10 feet off the ground than you will need about 30 feet of rope, 2 carabiners, 2 rappel rings, and 2 tree protectors (or towels if you don’t have any). I will provide some links on where to get some of these materials.
        Beginning steps Second you will find a space where two trees with a minimum diameter of 16 inches are far apart enough for you to be able to take a few steps on, maybe around 10 feet. 
        After you have found a good place to start, then you will move on to step three.
        For the third step you will put the tree protection on the trees and wrap the webbing around. {Follow embedded video}
        How to take steps:
        {Video}
        There are multiple ways to stand up on a slackline. The easiest is to first put one leg up and place your foot firmly on the slackline with the line running through the center of your foot. With your other foot placed on the ground below you, raise your arms for balance. Next, you will want to put slight pressure on your foot placed on the line. It might wobble but try to find the center of balance. Then in one motion put all your weight onto the leg that is on the line and raise your body up and over the slackline. You should move straight up and not to any side. Then in that same previous motion, put your free foot behind or in front of your foot on the line. This may take a couple tries or days even. Take it at your own pace. Once you finally can get up and not fall off immediately, focus straight in front of you and try to take a couple of steps. Listen to your body’s movements and try to place balance where it is needed.
        Suggestions/ tips: 
        Focus one a single spot on the edge of the rope, don’t look down or at the rope. 
        Move your arms to distribute weight and find your balance.
        It’s normal if your legs are shaky, they are working new muscles that have never been used before.
        Ideally you want your shoes to be flat, many slackliners do it barefoot.
        Keep the rope clean from dirt from your shoes to protect the ropes integrity.
