        <p> What is slacklining? Slacklining is balancing on a one- to two-inch-wide flat rope called tubular webbing which is fixed to normally two points (for example: trees). Slacklining is a great sport for those wanting to find an independent sport, that helps with balance, strength, and can also be shared with others. Types of slacklines There are many different types of slacklining, including: Waterlining, Highlining, Tricklining, Yogalining, and Rodeolining. With all these different types of slacklining, they all require similar skills, gear, and knowledge. Waterlining is slacklining over water which can be difficult but is safer. Highlining is slacklining over 10 meters in height. To highline requires a lot of safety, a rig that uses a specific system, and care. You will also need a harness to attach yourself to the line incase of a fall. After taking the care and precautions of making highlining safe, it is a very safe sport. Tricklining is slacklining with stretchy tubular webbing with high tensions (like a thin trampoline). Trickliners have done some amazing tricks on these things. Yogalining is practicing yoga poses on a slacklining. This creates a yoga experience that is even more intense and interesting. Rodeoline is a slackline with loose tension, creating a more U shape than a line. This is primarily more for training and swinging the line from side to side. This website is to help you get started with slacklining and see if this is the sport for you.</p>
